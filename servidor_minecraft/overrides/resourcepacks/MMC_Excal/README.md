### Clarent (FFE) was created and is maintained by GrandPappyJay

    This is an Add-on Pack for the Excalibur Resource Pack (by Maffhew) with alternative support for Optifine features...
    This pack aims to recreate Excalibur as intended without changing anything unecessarily...  
    Fabric Friendly Excalibur was started in conjunction with TrinalDust to support all Excalibur features on the Fabric Mod Loader...  
    Quilt support was added with the release of Fabric Friendly Excalibur v2.1 and moving forward from v3.2 the project 
    has been renamed to Clarent and now supports Optifine Alternatives for Forge, Fabric, and Quilt and patch bugs that are
    identified between official releases...    

    Be aware that the mods listed below get updated and sometimes changes that will require this pack to be 
    updated to work completely again... I don't control any of the mods required and am not responsible for 
    issues their updates may cause...

    Report bugs with the pack to @GrandPappyJay in the Excalibur Discord Channel... 
    I will make updates to the pack as necessary and time allows...

    The following mods are recomended for greatest performance and the desired effect.
    Refer to each mod's page for all necessary supporting mods that may be required.
    Make sure to download the correct version for your Mod Loader and Minecraft version.
